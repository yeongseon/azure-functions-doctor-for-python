## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/azure-functions-doctor-for-python.git
   cd azure-functions-doctor-for-python
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-functions-doctor-for-python.git
   ```

4. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

6. **Install pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

7. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   make check-all
   python -m azure_functions_doctor.cli diagnose --help
   ```

## Code Style

We maintain high code quality standards:

### Tools We Use
* **Formatter:** `black` - Consistent code formatting
* **Linter:** `ruff` - Fast Python linter
* **Type checker:** `mypy` - Static type checking
* **Import sorting:** `isort` - Consistent import ordering

### Code Standards
* Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
* Use type hints for all function signatures
* Write descriptive variable and function names
* Add docstrings for public functions and classes
* Keep functions focused and small
* Use meaningful commit messages (Conventional Commits)

### Before Submitting
```bash
make format      # Format code with black
make lint        # Lint with ruff
make typecheck   # Type check with mypy
make test        # Run tests
make check-all   # Run all checks
```

## Adding New Features

### Adding New Diagnostic Rules

Our diagnostic system is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **Define the rule** in `src/azure_functions_doctor/assets/rules.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "check_my_feature",
     "type": "my_check_type",
     "label": "My Feature Check",
     "description": "Checks if my feature is properly configured",
     "section": "my_section",
     "required": true,
     "severity": "error",
     "condition": {
       "target": "my_target"
     },
     "hint": "How to fix this issue",
     "hint_url": "https://docs.example.com/fix-guide"
   }
   ```

2. **Implement the handler** in `src/azure_functions_doctor/handlers.py`:
   ```python
   def my_check_handler(rule: Rule, path: Path) -> dict[str, str]:
       # Implementation here
       return _create_result("pass", "Check passed")
   ```

3. **Add handler to dispatcher** in `generic_handler` function

4. **Write tests** in `tests/test_handler.py`

5. **Update documentation** if needed

### Architecture Overview

```
src/azure_functions_doctor/
├── cli.py           # CLI interface and logging setup
├── doctor.py        # Core diagnostic engine
├── handlers.py      # Individual check implementations
├── logging_config.py # Centralized logging system
├── target_resolver.py # Version resolution utilities
└── assets/
    └── rules.json   # Declarative rule definitions
```

### Handler Guidelines

- Always return `{"status": str, "detail": str}`
- Use `_create_result()` for consistent responses
- Handle exceptions with `_handle_exception()`
- Add appropriate logging with `logger.debug()` or `logger.warning()`
- Keep handlers focused on a single responsibility
- Add comprehensive error handling

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main

   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly

4. **Run all checks**:
   ```bash
   make check-all
   ```

5. **Commit with conventional commits**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(handlers): add new diagnostic rule for X"
   ```

### PR Requirements

- Branch from `main`
