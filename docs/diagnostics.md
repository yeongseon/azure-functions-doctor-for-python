## ðŸ™º Diagnostic Checks

This document lists diagnostic checks for **Azure Functions Doctor**, based on [Azure Functions Python Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python?tabs=get-started%2Casgi%2Capplication-level&pivots=python-mode-decorators) and [Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-best-practices?tabs=python).

The tool supports both **Programming Model v1** (function.json-based) and **Programming Model v2** (decorator-based) projects, automatically detecting the model and applying appropriate checks.

Note: Checks now produce only three statuses: pass, warn (optional check failed), fail (required check failed).
