# 🩺 Azure Functions Doctor

Welcome to **Azure Functions Doctor** — a powerful diagnostic CLI tool built with Python to help you validate and troubleshoot your local Azure Functions environment.

---

## What Is It?

**Azure Functions Doctor** analyzes your project folder and environment to detect:

- Missing configuration files (e.g., `host.json`, `requirements.txt`)
- Unsupported Python versions
- Missing dependencies (e.g., `azure-functions`)
- Broken or misnamed function folders
- Other common issues that break Azure Functions locally or in CI/CD

It provides **clear emoji-based output**, **rule-based extensibility**, and **optional JSON formatting**.

| Developing locally | Quickly catch broken setup before you run `func start` |
| 🚢 Before deployment | Prevent silent 500 errors caused by bad config |
| 🔁 In CI pipeline | Automate validation across repos and branches |
| Debugging errors | Eliminate basic mistakes before diving into logs |
