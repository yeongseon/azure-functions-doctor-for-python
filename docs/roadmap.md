# Roadmap

## Vision

Transform **Azure Functions Doctor** from a basic environment validator into a comprehensive static analysis and CI/CD platform for Azure Functions development teams.

Our goal is to become the essential quality assurance tool for Azure Functions projects, providing deep insights into code quality, security, performance, and best practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## Current State (v0.1.x)

### What We Have Today
- ✅ Basic environment validation (Python version, virtual environment, packages)
- ✅ Configuration file validation (`host.json`, `local.settings.json`, project structure)
- ✅ Extensible rule-based diagnostic system via `rules.json`
- ✅ CLI interface with colorized output and JSON format support
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and open source contribution guidelines

### Current Limitations
- Limited to basic setup validation
- Static file checks only, no code analysis
- Manual execution required
- No CI/CD integration
- No security or performance insights
